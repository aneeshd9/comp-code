# Breadth first search

1. In unweighted graphs, finds shortest path, i.e., path with the least number of edges.
2. O(n + m) complexity.

## Applications:

1. Find the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
2. Find all connected components. O(n + m) time.
3. Find fastest solution to a game, if the states form a graph.
4. 0-1 BFS. (See shortest paths section: cp-algorithms/graphs/single-source-shortest-paths)
5. Find shortest cycle in a directed unweighted graph.
6. Find all edges that lie on the shortest path(s) between two vertices.
7. Find all vertices that lie on the shortest path(s) between two vertices.
8. Find the shortest path of even length between two vertices. Construct and auxiliary graph
with parity.
